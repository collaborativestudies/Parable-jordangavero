    <h2>Enter the Story</h2>
    <p>Parable LA was formed after 11 years of ministry to urban youth in the Los Angeles area of Southern California. The youth of today are struggling with anxiety, depression, loneliness, abuse and many other forms of hopelessness. At Parable LA, we enter into their space, go where they are and tell them the stories of Jesus. It all starts with free pizza at their high school campus.</p>
    <p>We meet students where they are at with the redeeming power of the gospel until they realize they are seen, heard, and loved by God and us.</p>
    <p>The Parable LA Team serves the youth of their city by connecting with them on 14 campuses across the region. Whether it’s an on-campus club, skate park, local neighborhoods, sports team practices or a local lunch spot, the relationships are built to bring the love of Jesus to teenagers.</p>
