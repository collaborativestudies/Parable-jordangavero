        <h2>Jordan Gavero</h2>
        <p> Jordan, a Long Beach native, has a deep passion for Jesus, cherishes time with his wife Hanna, and strives to share that love with others. Raised in a home where his young parents had recently committed their lives to Jesus, Jordan was surrounded by faith from an early age. He gave his life to Jesus in 2008 and continued to grow in his faith. After graduating high school in 2013, Jordan pursued college and completed his studies in 2017. He then fulfilled a childhood dream by working in the television industry for four years. Despite his professional success, he still felt a deep inner longing to be seen and known. In 2020, Jordan experienced a pivotal season when he ended a seven-year relationship and lost his stable career, leading to a sense of lost identity. However, this challenging period became a turning point, reviving his relationship with Jesus. In the midst of grappling with his emotions, thoughts, and losses, he encountered Jesus in a transformative way. This marked his first significant interior journey of self-examination, enriching his faith. Today, Jordan finds satisfaction in the person God is shaping him to become. As he continues his ministry journey, he deeply desires to be fully known by God. The passion to explore this profound love has been present since his youth, and he is committed to discovering it further as he serves at Parable.</p>
